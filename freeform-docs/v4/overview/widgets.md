## Stats widget

![Stats widget](../images/cp_widget-stats.png)

This is a simple widget (included with all editions of Freeform) that allows you to display some basic information about your Freeform submissions and setup. You can display stats for all forms or for individual form(s), as well as filter the stats by statuses.

When running into issues with Freeform, it can particularly be helpful when contacting Solspace Support (by just taking a screenshot of it), as it provides a glimpse of your setup and amount of data.

* Total submissions
* Blocked spam submissions
	* Counts can be reset per form in **Freeform > Forms** page.
* Total number of forms
* Total number of form fields
* Total number of email notification templates
