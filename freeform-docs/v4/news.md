## What's New!

### Improved Headless Support in Freeform 4.1

In Freeform 4.1, we went the extra mile to ensure robust support for [headless](./headless/) website architecture. We improved querying form layouts and added support for using [mutations](./headless/graphql/#mutations) to create submissions via [GraphQL](./headless/graphql/). We built complete and interactive demos for JavaScript-based front-end frameworks such as [Vue.js](./headless/vuejs/), [Next.js](./headless/nextjs/), [React JS](./headless/reactjs/) and more!

### Additional Sample Formatting Templates

We've rolled out a variety of new "basic" formatting templates. They are included in Freeform as a starting point, but they are beautiful and clean enough to be used as is if you wish! They are not dependent on any external libraries or frameworks either.

Check out the new plug-and-play formatting templates here:

- [Basic Light](./templates/formatting/basic-light/)
- [Basic Dark](./templates/formatting/basic-dark/)
- [Basic Floating Labels](./templates/formatting/basic-floating-labels/)
    - Displays labels in the center of the inputs and shrinks them to the top-right when clicked and/or contains a value.
- [Conversational](./templates/formatting/conversational/)
    - Displays 1 field at a time, and smoothly scroll down to the next question until complete. It behaves similarly to how _Typeform_ displays forms, and is also a great choice for survey forms.

## Roadmap
We have packed our schedule with many exciting updates and additions for Freeform!

### Freeform 5 Beta

We have been working on extensively redesigning and improving the Freeform form builder to be even more intuitive! In addition to that are a variety of other improvements and new features! A beta will be available to try out in July 2023.

### Simple User Mode
We've heard your feedback, and we're now working on an update that will allow very granular control over the form-building experience for client users. With these controls, you'll be able to set defaults for most settings and options and choose if the setting should be limited or completely hidden. This will dramatically clean up and improve the client user experience, and prevent them from accessing settings that could easily break forms, etc.

Stay tuned for more updates!
