# Mailing List Integrations

Freeform supports some popular mailing list integrations. Inside the [Settings](../../setup/settings/#mailing-lists) area of Freeform, there is a Mailing List API Integration Manager, which allows you to manage your mailing list API integrations.

The following Mailing List integrations are currently available for **Freeform Pro** only (click each one for individual setup instructions):

* [MailChimp](./mailchimp/)
* [Constant Contact](./constant-contact/)
* [Campaign Monitor](./campaign-monitor/)

Some important things to know about Mailing List integrations are:

* Mailing list integrations are globally available to all forms, but are configured per form inside the Composer interface.
* Most - if not all - integrations attempt to map all available fields and custom fields, but some may have limitations if the API is too complex or doesn't allow it.
* Mailing list integrations appear as a checkbox that can be drag and dropped into the Composer interface:
	* Can only be displayed as a single checkbox. If you want more than 1 mailing list, you can drag and drop another field into your layout (but the checkboxes cannot be displayed as a group, unless of course you made some manual adjustments to the formatting template).
		* Label of the checkbox is customizable per form.
		* Checkbox can be checked by default.
	* You can specify the mailing list to be used for the mailing list integration.
	* Your form must include an [Email](../../overview/fields-field-types/#fields-email) field type, which must then be assigned to the **Target Email Field** setting.
	* When available, **Field Mapping** setting allows you to map Freeform fields to available mailing list integration fields.
* Older versions of Freeform "Basic/Lite" included *MailChimp* integration built in. While this was removed from new purchases of Freeform Lite in **1.8**, customers that previously purchased older versions will continue to have access to a special version of Freeform Lite that includes MailChimp.
* To get access to all integrations, purchase (or purchase an upgrade to) [Freeform Pro](https://solspace.com/craft/freeform/pro).

Every integration is a little bit different, so we have detailed instructions for setting up each integration on their own page.
