## Craft Demo Sites
We are pleased that Craft has chosen to include Freeform in both of their website demos. These demos allow you to experience Craft from the control panel and front end website. Because of this, you can also experience Freeform inside the control panel as well. Be sure to visit the **Plugin Store** area of the Craft control panel to switch the license edition to **Pro** to get the full experience of Freeform! P.S. The form used to request access to the demo sites is also built on Freeform. ðŸ™‚
