We also assume that you have a [Campaign Monitor](http://campaignmonitor.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have *Freeform Pro*. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

Campaign Monitor integration includes support for the following:

* Field mapping to standard and custom fields of the following types:
	* Text

	* Multiple Options (can select many)
