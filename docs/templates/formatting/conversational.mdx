The Conversational formatting template will display 1 field at a time, and smoothly scroll down to the next question until complete. It will appear and behave similarly to how [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) displays forms, and is also a great choice for survey forms. This formatting template example is not dependent on any frameworks, comes complete and does not require any additional styling unless you wish to do so. You can place the CSS and JS inside the formatting template or add to your site's CSS / JS files.
