# Bootstrap 5 Dark Mode <Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 5.0+" />

The following example assumes you're including necessary [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com) JS and CSS as well as the <code>data-bs-theme="dark"</code> attribute to a parent element (such as `html` or an outer `div` tag). You can place the additional CSS and JS inside the formatting template or add to your site's CSS / JS files.

:::warning
_Dark Mode_ relies on features newly available in the [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) version in order to work.
