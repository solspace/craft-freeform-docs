The _Basic Dark_ template is intended to be a neatly styled basic formatting template that is plug-and-play and doesn't require any frameworks or toolkits, etc. This formatting template is ready-to-go on "dark" pages and does not require any additional styling unless you wish to do so. You can place the CSS and JS inside the formatting template or add to your site's CSS / JS files.
