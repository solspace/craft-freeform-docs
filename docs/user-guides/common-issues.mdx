## 404 Errors for `freeform/plugin.js`

Some fields and other JS in my form is not working correctly. I'm also seeing this error in the browser console: `freeform/plugin.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`.

<AnswerCard>
If the JS in your form is not working and you're seeing an error like `freeform/plugin.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)` in the browser console, it's almost certainly due to your site having server rules you have applied to JS and CSS files to see if they are actual files. The default for Freeform is to load its scripts as **Static URLs**, which becomes a problem in this case. To resolve this issue, you can switch the _Freeform Script Insert Type_ setting (_Craft CP → Freeform → Settings → Form Behavior_) to **As Files** instead.

- **As Static URLs** <Badge type="recommended" text="Recommended" /> offers built-in browser caching and a static endpoint that delivers the latest Freeform scripts, but are not physical files and therefore cannot have server rules applied.
- **As Files** (recommended if having issues with _Static URLs_) are actual physical files generated inside of the `cpresources` folder by Craft's asset manager with no caching.
- **Inline** will add the scripts as inline scripts and may be useful as a workaround if the other 2 options are not working. This doesn't allow for caching, and pollutes the source code.

:::tip
If you're experiencing this issue only in one environment (like production), it's perfectly safe to just set all environments to use **As Files** without issue.

## How do I transfer local `dev` changes to `production`?

I have a made a number of updates and changes to my Freeform setup on my local dev environment. I'd like to move that over to the staging/production environments. Is this possible?

<AnswerCard>
If you're wondering how to independently carry over changes/additions to forms, fields, submissions, etc from one environment to another, this is not currently possible. The issue is that Freeform submissions are technically Craft elements and therefore, things are intertwined within the Craft `elements`, `elements_sites`, and `content` database tables. Freeform forms are stored as JSON in the `freeform_forms` database table, but the fields within are also attached to the `freeform_fields` and `freeform_submissions` database tables, complicating it further. And finally, if form data and layouts were stored inside the Craft _project config_, it would mean that forms could not be created and edited on sites that use the `allowAdminChanges` setting in Craft. This might work for some customers, but definitely not everyone.

<secret>
  A future version of Freeform will eventually include an import/export utility
  that will solve this issue.
