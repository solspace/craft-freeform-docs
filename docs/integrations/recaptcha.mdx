# reCAPTCHA <Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 5.0+" />

Freeform includes an integration for Google [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/). Check out the options below.

## Overview

All **reCAPTCHA** offerings will be automatically loaded and handled by Freeform (when enabled for the form). The **reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox** field will be automatically inserted above the Submit button(s).

Each _reCAPTCHA_ integration is managed inside the _Captchas_ area under Settings and then further configurable per form inside the form builder. Every integration is a little bit different, so please follow the detailed instructions for setting up the integration below.

## Supported Types

Below is a list of the _reCAPTCHA_ integrations supported by Freeform and how each of them work.

### reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox

All users submitting your form must check off the reCAPTCHA checkbox, and in some cases, users will be presented the puzzle to solve to submit the form successfully. This is available in all editions of Freeform.

### reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible <Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Most users will not even know it's automatically validating them, but like the reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox described above, some users will be presented a modal on the page with the puzzle to solve when they click the submit button.

### reCAPTCHA v3 <Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Users are never presented any puzzle to solve, etc. Instead, users are automatically validated by Google based on a score assigned to them. You have control over that score threshold inside Freeform settings. We suggest starting with something like `0.5` and see how that goes (where a `0.0` score means that it's almost certain a bot and a `1.0` score means it's a user). If the user does not pass this threshold, the submission will follow the behavior you set out for it in the settings (send to spam folder / reject it entirely / show an error to the user, etc). The user has no ability to validate themselves like in **reCAPTCHA v2**.

## Behavior & Overrides

The following options are available for adjusting the behavior of _reCAPTCHA_ and overriding at the template-level.

### Only load Captcha scripts once the user interacts with the form

If you'd like to have the associated Captcha scripts load only once a user begins filling out the form, enable the corresponding setting inside the **Captchas** settings page. If you'd like your forms to be ready to go at page load, disable this setting.

### Disabling Captchas

To disable Captchas per form at template level, add the `disableCaptcha: true` parameter to the [Form query](../templates/queries/form/).

### Add Attributes to Wrapper <Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.1+" />

You can add attributes to the main Captcha wrapper that is automatically inserted by Freeform.

```twig
{{ form.render({
  captchas: {
    class: ["custom-class", "another-class"],
    "data-test": true,
  }
}) }}
```
