# Email Notifications

Freeform allows you to send email notifications upon submittal of a form. They are global and can be reused for multiple forms, saving you time when you are managing many forms.

:::tip
Be sure to configure the [Email Alert](../configuration/settings/#notices-alerts) feature. It allows you to automatically send an email notification alerting the email address(es) specified when an email notification cannot be delivered.

- [Admin](#admin)
- [Conditional](#conditional) <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />
- [User Select](#user-select) <BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>
- [Email Fields](#email-fields)
- [User-Defined](#user-defined)
- [Template-based](#template-based)
