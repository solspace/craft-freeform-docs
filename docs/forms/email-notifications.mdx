Freeform allows you to send email notifications upon submittal of a form. They are global and can be reused for multiple forms, saving you time when you are managing many forms.

:::tip
Be sure to configure the [Email Alert](../configuration/settings/#notices-alerts) feature. It allows you to automatically send an email notification alerting the email address(es) specified when an email notification cannot be delivered.

- [Admin](#admin)
- [Conditional](#conditional) <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />
- [User Select](#user-select) <BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>
- [Email Fields](#email-fields)
- [User-Defined](#user-defined)
- [Template-based](#template-based)

### Admin

Email notifications can be sent upon successful submit of the form to one or more admin email addresses.

    _New_ button beside the **Admin** menu.

    setting. If you haven't created any yet, be sure to do so.
  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    In the **Recipients** area, add any email address(es) you'd like to receive
    an email notification each time the form is submitted successfully. If you
    need to specify more than one email address, hit _Enter_ and additional
    email inputs will appear.
  </StepMarkdown>
</VerticalStepWrapper>

### Conditional<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.0+" />

</VerticalStepWrapper>

### User Select<BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup><Badge type="feature" text="Renamed & Improved for 5.0+" />

Email notifications can be sent to one or more pre-defined admin email addresses that are selected by the user filling out the form using any [Dropdown](./fields/#dropdown), [Checkbox](./fields/#checkbox), [Checkboxes](./fields/#checkboxes), [Radios](./fields/#radios), [Multi-Select](./fields/#multiple-select) field types. For example, you might have a **Dropdown** field that contains different departments for the user to address the email to.

:::warning
Be sure to set up your option fields as usual, and do not set email addresses as their options. That part is done inside the **Notifications** tab.
