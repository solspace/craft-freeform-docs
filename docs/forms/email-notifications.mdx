# Email Notifications

Freeform allows you to send email notifications upon submittal of a form. They are global and can be reused for multiple forms, saving you time when you are managing many forms.

:::tip
Be sure to configure the [Email Alert](../configuration/settings/#notices-alerts) feature. It allows you to automatically send an email notification alerting the email address(es) specified when an email notification cannot be delivered.
