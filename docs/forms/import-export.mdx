## Overview

Freeform includes an import and export utility that allows you to granularly import and export partial or entire Freeform setups from one site or environment to another. This could be used for performing site updates across environments and syncing changes in Freeform, or as a boilerplate for new sites.

Imports & Exports can include:

- Forms (incuding layout, notifications, rules, integrations, settings)
- Form Submissions
- Templates (including email notification, formatting, success, PDF)
- Freeform Settings
- Integrations
